# **NOTE:** After some consideration, I have decided to shutdown the Poixpixel Minecraft server and not work on it. What this means for the plugin is that I will not be working on it anymore. This repository will be archived for nowand I will focus on working on other things for the time being. I might come back to this in the future but foe now, I have more important things to work on.
